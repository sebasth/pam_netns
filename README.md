# pam_netns (CentOS, RedHat, AMI version)

## what is this

Simple demonstration applying pre-configured network namespaces to user session using Pluggable Authentication Modules.

## what is your use case?

You can have multiple linux users on one server to each use/see only their own designated network.
Without this, all linux users share same, default network configuration.
With this, users can also be isolated according to IP and network rules, in addition to user/group permissions.
Linux has Network Namespaces which enable administrators to create multiple independent networks and then run processes bound to those networks. With this script, users can be bound to those networks.


## Awesome/awful, should I use it?

Probably not.

## Requirements

- Python: 

    yum install python26 python26-devel python26-sphinx

- `pam_python`, a PAM-to-Python adapter, enabling one to run Python scripts as PAM modules.

A patch to make it build on CentOS, here: https://sourceforge.net/p/pam-python/tickets/4/attachment/pam-python-1.0.7.from-1.0.6.patch



## Example

Configure a network namespace using `ip netns`:

    ip netns add ns0
    
    # loopback up
    ip netns exec ns0 ip link set dev lo up

 *NOTE:* By default namespaces configured with `ip netns` are not preserved across reboots. You need to write your own script to restore them on boot.

Place configuration in `/etc/security/pam_netns.conf`. Configuration file contains one username and network namespace name per line. Do not use hash comments. To map user *test* to *ns0*:

    test ns0
    
Configure PAM to use this module when creating a session. 
For CentOS based distributions add to the end of `/etc/pam.d/sshd`:

    session optional pam_python.so /etc/secirity/pam_python/pam_netns.py

Possible options:
   
   * `config=<path>` use alternative location for configuration file. Default: `/etc/security/pam_netns.conf`
   * `log=<path>` additional logging to a separate log. Default: empty (no logging)
   * `debug` more verbose logging
   
## Bugs

When using `sudo`, `su` etc., the network namespace is not changd back to default (pid 1) one.
